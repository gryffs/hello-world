# hello-world
practice makes perfect

I'm married to my best friend.  We have six awesome children.  Yes, we know what causes it and we like it (hence the children :)).  I'm a twelve year Veteran of the U.S. Army (Paratrooper, Infantryman, UNIX sysAdmin, SharePoint sysAdmin) and six year business leader (Private Money Lender, Loan Receivables, Timber Land Management, Beyond Organic Farming).  I consider myself a Renaissance Man and an Intellectual Agrarian.  My latest excursion is into the world of Computer Science and JavaScript Programming.
